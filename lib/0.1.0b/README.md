# Cosmos 0.1.0 Beta Private Release

THIS PROJECT IS LICENSED UNDER THE MIT LICENSE. DO NOT DO ANYTHING THAT THE MIT
LICENSE DISALLOWS. IT IS THERE FOR A REASON.

If you are looking to add Cosmos to your projects, please place a copy of the
License that can be found at `/LICENSE` in the same directory as the `cosmos.js`
or `cosmos.min.js` files, and call it `cosmos.LICENSE`.

As quoted from the license document:

*"Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software..."*

This means that I cannot sell Cosmos to anybody, so neither can you. Please do
not be a jerk and make profits off of other people's things, because the law
will catch up to you, and will put you in a hard place.

As also quoted from the license document:

*"THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED..."*

So I will not make edits to the Cosmos source files just to please a single
person or small group of people. I will also not be responsible when Cosmos
**may** crash a weak computer running on a ram intensive browser.

Thank you for reading this document, and may you have an enjoyable time working
with Cosmos!
